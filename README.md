Very Noise
==========
Very Noise (or VNoise) is a simple coherent noise generator that uses the command line. It outputs either 8 or 16 bit grayscale PNG images.

The idea of this project is not to create a fully-fledged procedural texture generator, but to create a basic noise generator that can be used in conjunction with command line image editing tools such as ImageMagick to create more advanced textures.

Use the binary with the --help argument to learn more.

Examples
--------
All examples are built with the same random seed in order to better show the effects of the different parameters.
