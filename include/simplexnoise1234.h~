 /* Minor changes by Mike Pedersen
  * Instead of having a constant permutation table, the snoise_init
  * function builds it. This allows the snoise functions to change
  * based on a seed value. This file, along with simplexnoise1234.c,
  * is still under public domain, though this might not necessarily
  * be true for the rest of the project

/*
 * This is a clean, fast, modern and free Perlin Simplex noise function.
 * It is a stand-alone compilation unit with no external dependencies,
 * highly reusable without source code modifications.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * Replacing the "float" type with "double" can actually make this run faster
 * on some platforms. Having both versions could be useful.
